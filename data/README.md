The data used in these brief methods papers comes from the 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The full data set has been limited to Missouri residents and 20 variables. The code for cleaning the data set from the full SAS Transport file can be found in this directory.

To reduce storage, the original full file is not saved here. It, along with a codebook, is available on the BRFSS website [[link](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2018.html)].

The BRFSS employs a complex sample with strata and clusters and uses survey weights to account for non-response and missing data. These complexities are ignored in the brief methods examples.
